      <description>OnePlus 5 Smart Review OnePlus 5, reviewing this phone gives me lot of satisfaction as i am a big fan of OnePlus phones whether its any variant of One Plus. I must tell you buying this phone is worth for its price and you wont&amp;rsquo;t regret it. Last year the company had launced OnePlus 3T which made huge profit for the company almost in every country wherever it was launched.</description>
